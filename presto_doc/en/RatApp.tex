\FuncDef{[SS]=RatApp(S,n,Is\_type,solver)}
{\fitem[SS] S enriched with the computed rational approximation}
{\fitem[S] S-structure for which completion and Fourier coeffs. have
  been computed
\fitem[n] Target MacMillan degree
\fitem[Is\_type=DVC.RA.divide\_by\_z\_minus\_one] Type of isometry used to pass to the circle. $L^2$ and
  $L^{\infty}$ isometries are available. For the $L^2$ isometry the
  value at $\infty$ for $S_{1,1}$ and $S_{2,2}$ is first
  subtracted. Possible values are 0 for $L^{\infty}$ and 1 for $L^2$.
\fitem[solver=DVC.RA.solver\_flag] Specifies which rational approximation engine to
use, i.e RARL2 [\ref{polo}] and hyperion [\ref{jose}] are available. The
corresponding argument values are \{'RARL2','HARL2'\}
}  
{}
{ The engine hyperion is only available under linux. }
