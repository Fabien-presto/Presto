\FuncDef{[So]=CompFourierCoeffs(Si)}
{\fitem[So] Si enriched with the Fourier coefficients of each channel}
{\fitem[Si] S-structure for which completion to infty exists}
{\fitem[DVC.CFC.n\_Fourier] Number of Fourier coefficients to be computed
\fitem[DVC.CFC.n\_comp] Number of points taken in completion evaluation
\fitem[DVC.CFC.n\_spline] Number of points taken after splines
(interpolating data and completion) have been
computed. Those evaluation points are used in the to evaluate integrals for Fourier
coeffs. computation.
}
{The procedure computes positive and negative indexed Fourier
  coefficients. The positive ones are added to the S-structure, the
  negative ones are used to compute the ``distance'' to causality
  see [\ref{Comp}].
